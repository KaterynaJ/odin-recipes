    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The dried pear in this recipe is the secret ingredient that makes the taste of borscht simply amazing. You can’t imagine how much flavor can come from this small fruit and how perfectly it complements the borscht, giving it a smoked taste.</p>
    <p>If you want to add even more flavor nuances to your borscht, you can include more vegetables. For example, you can make a vegetable broth using celery root or parsley root, add mushrooms or sweet peppers. Be sure to let the cooked borscht sit for at least an hour so that the flavor becomes even richer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>2 l of water (68 oz)</li><li>1 whole beets, scrubbed</li><li>1 whole carrots, scrubbed</li><li>1 white onions
</li><li>2 firm medium potatoes, peeled and diced
</li><li>¼ head of a medium cabbage, cored</li><li>2 tablespoons (30 grams) tomato paste</li><li>2 smoked pears
</li><li>1 tablespoons (15 grams) sugar
</li><li>2 bay leaf
</li><li>2 cloves garlic
</li><li>Sunflower oil (or other neutral oil)
</li><li>A few allspice berries
</li><li>Kosher salt to taste
</li>
<li>Sour cream and fresh parsley, for garnishing (optional)
</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Wash a medium-sized beetroot, wrap it in foil, and place it in the oven for 90 minutes. Let it cool, then peel and grate it using a grater with large holes.
</li><li>Also, grate a large carrot and finely chop the onion. Heat a pan with 2 tbsp of sunflower oil. Add the onions and carrots, and fry for 3 minutes.
</li><li>Then add the grated beets and fry for another 2 minutes. Pour 1 tbsp of sugar and add 2 tbsp of tomato paste into the pan. Stir and simmer for another 2 minutes.
</li><li>Peel two medium-sized potatoes and cut them into small cubes. Pour 2 l of water into a pot and add the potatoes. Include 2 bay leaves and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for another 5 minutes.
</li><li>Add ¼ head of a medium cabbage. Cook for 15 minutes, then transfer the cooked cabbage to a pan. Cut 2 dried pears into thin slices and add them to the pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste and cook for another 7 minutes. Finally, add 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic.
</li><li>Simmer everything for 5 more minutes and take off the heat. Serve hot (although borsch is also great the next day; after it has had a chance to rest, the taste intensifies even more). Garnish with sour cream and fresh parsley (optional).
