    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Difficulty: hard.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>500 g / 4 cups all-purpose flour
</li>
<li>300 ml / 1¼ cups water
</li>
<li>10 g / ⅓ oz. active dry yeast
</li>
<li>1 tsp. sugar
</li>
<li>½ tsp. salt
</li>
<li>150 g / 5 oz. beetroot
</li>
<li>100 g / 3½ oz. bacon
</li>
<li>vegetable oil (to grease the bowl)
</li></ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol><li>Wash the beetroot, wrap it in foil and bake at 185°С /365°F for 60–90 minutes (depending on size). Leave it to cool, then peel and cut into small cubes.
</li>
<li>Dice the bacon and fry until golden brown.
</li>
<li>Put flour through a sieve and mix with salt. Dissolve the yeast in warm water, add sugar. Leave it for 15 minutes to give the yeast time to wake up and become active.
</li>
<li>Add yeast to the mixture of flour with salt, and knead the dough until soft and elastic. Knead in the fried bacon and beetroot cubes. Form a dough ball and carefully move it to an oiled bowl. Leave it in a warm place for 40 minutes until bread rises and doubles or triples in volume.
</li>
<li>Press down the dough and form a round shape. Place it on a baking paper-lined tray and sprinkle it with flour. Leave for 30 more minutes to rise some more.
</li>
<li>Bake at 220°C / 425°F for 5 minutes. Then turn the temperature down to 180°C / 350°F and cook for 30 more minutes.
